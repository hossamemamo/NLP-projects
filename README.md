# NLP Projects and Learning

Welcome to the NLP Projects and Learning repository! This repository is dedicated to projects and learning materials related to natural language processing (NLP). while also following along with Stanford's CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course as a reference.
Please note that this repo is a work in progress!
## Goals

- [x] Implement Ara2vec model
- [ ] (to be decided yet)

## Ara2vec

The first project in this repository is the implementation of the Ara2vec model, which aims to replicate the word2vec model for Arabic language. The model is trained on Arabic Wikipedia data and can be used for various NLP tasks such as word similarity and analogy.

## Usage

To use the projects in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project of interest. Each project will have its own README file with detailed instructions on how to use it.
